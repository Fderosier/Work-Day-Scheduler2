# Calender-work-scheduler
Work-day-scheduler

The purpose of this project was to allow a user to save important notes corresponding to hours in a 9 to 5 workday. The user will be able to see the current date on the top of the page, and the app alters CSS colors to make important tasks more easily identifiable.

Usage

When the user has clicked the save button, the text area will be saved to local storage for further use. Under the hood, using JS, Jquery, and Day.JS, the user can have their hours color-coded based on the current time. The current time will show as red, past will show gray, and the future will come in as green. The top of the scheduler will also feature the current date. All of the user's input is stored locally and can be called to the page if the user does not clear it. The user can delete and click save to empty out an hour's text slot.

Conclusion

In conclusion, This site is ideal for any person/business that is trying to be more organized.
